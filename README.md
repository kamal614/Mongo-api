API Implementation and Integration:

• Develop an API to fetch a list of users/data with pagination logic. The
backend can be written in any language, but the database must be
MongoDB.
• Integrate this API into your Flutter application. The UI should allow
users to:
➢ Specify the number of items per page and the page number.
➢ View the current page, the next page, and the number of
pages remaining.

SETUP:
1. Clone the flutter code and run on your system.
2. To setup api you need to go to "lib" folder > then "node_code" > "app.js"
3. in my case I've hosted this app.js on glitch.com
4. It can we directly hosted on the glitch.com
5. Just sign up there and copy the code.
6. It will automatically install adn you API will be live.

PS: API is hosted on the free platform, so it might have some delays to get the response
